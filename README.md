# Exile Diary Reborn

A game tracker for Path of Exile. Tracks literally everything that drops in your maps, and more!

The app currently tracks : 
- Your stash tabs content from the GGG API
- Your loot when running any maps or run and its value
- The stats (IIR/IIQ/Map Tier) of your maps based on text recognition on screenshots you take
- Your kill count in your runs based on your incubators
- Many other quirky stats based on a combination of log-reading, screenshot-reading, GGG API, and internal timers


Get the latest version in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/qt-dev/exile-diary/releases)

Read more info about how to set it up in the [Documentation](https://github.com/qt-dev/exile-diary/wiki/How-to-track-your-map-runs).
